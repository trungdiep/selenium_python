{"category_product": "BABY-G", "introduce_product": "These new analog-digital additions to the BABY-G G-LIDE sports lineup with Tide Graph capabilities go great with surfing and other casual styles. Unique thin-case designs are created based on the G-SHOCK like form of the 90s for a nostalgic retro look. There are three color combinations from which to choose: a mint green model that fits right in at the beach, plus a black and white model, both of which feature mint green accents.\r\nThese models always provide tide information, even while in the Timekeeping Mode. Each press of the button at 4 o'clock jumps ahead one hour to let you check future tide conditions. The index is designed to enhance readability. These new BABY-G models are designed to coordinate well with casual and summer beach wear.", "list_spec_icon": [{"spec_icon": "Super Illuminator", "detail_spec_icon": "Super Illuminator high-brightness LED Backlight"}, {"spec_icon": "Tide Graph", "detail_spec_icon": null}, {"spec_icon": " Moon Data", "detail_spec_icon": null}], "price_product": "99.00", "name_product": "BAX100-3A", "url_product": "https://www.casio.com/products/watches/baby-g/bax100-3a", "list_specification_product": ["1/100-second stopwatch", "Measuring capacity: 23:59'59.99", "Measuring modes: Elapsed time, split time, 1st-2nd place times", "12/24-hour format", "Accuracy: \u00b130 seconds per month", "Approx. battery life", "3 Years on CR1220", "Full auto-calendar (to year 2099)", "Button operation tone on/off", "Countdown timer", "Measuring unit: 1 second", "Countdown range: 24 hours", "Countdown start time setting range: 1 minute to 24 hours (1-minute increments and 1-hour increments)", "Other: Auto-repeat", "Dual time", "Hourly time signal", "LED light (Super Illuminator)", "Auto LED light, selectable illumination duration (1.5 seconds or 3 seconds), afterglow", "Moon data", "(Moon age of the specific date, moon phase graph)", "3 multi-function alarms (with 1 snooze alarm)\n", "Regular timekeeping", "Analog: 2 hands (Hour, minute (hand moves every 20 seconds))", "Digital: Hour, minute, second, pm, month, date, day", "Shock resistant", "Tide graph", "(Tide level for specific date and time)", "Module: 5605", "Size of case / total weight", "BAX-100 ...... 46.1 x 42.4 x 11.0 mm / 37 \""], "list_product_together_color": ["/products/watches/baby-g/ba110bc-1a", "/products/watches/baby-g/bax100-1a"]}
