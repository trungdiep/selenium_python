{"category_product": "BABY-G", "introduce_product": "The new BGA230SA models are designed with a pink gold metallic finish for the face ring of the black and beige models, and a gold finish for the white model face ring. Simple designs are created with bands and cases made of matte materials that provide a look of simple style, which is offset by faces that incorporate metal components. The safari beige model creates the feel of setting out on an exciting adventure in a faraway land. Function-wise, these models come with Dual Dial World Time, which uses a small dial at 9 o'clock to show the current time in a second time zone.", "list_spec_icon": [{"spec_icon": "100M Water Resistant", "detail_spec_icon": null}, {"spec_icon": "Daily Alarm", "detail_spec_icon": null}], "price_product": "120.00", "name_product": "BGA230SA-7A", "url_product": "https://www.casio.com/products/watches/baby-g/bga230sa-7a", "list_specification_product": ["Shock Resistant", "100M Water Resistant", "LED Light with Afterglow", "World Time", "31 time zones (48 cities + UTC), daylight saving on/off, home city/World time swapping", "Daily Alarm", "Hourly Time Signal", "1-second stopwatch", "Measuring capacity: 59\u201959", "Measuring modes: Elapsed time, split time, 1st-2nd place times", "Countdown Timer", "Measuring unit: 1 second", "Countdown range: 1 minute to 60 minutes (1-minute increments)", "Hand shift feature (Hands move out of the way to provide an unobstructed view of digital display contents)", "Button Operation Tone on/off", "Full auto-calendar (pre-programmed until the year 2099)", "12/24 Hour Formats", "Accuracy: +/-30 seconds per month", "Battery: SR726W x 2", "Approx.
